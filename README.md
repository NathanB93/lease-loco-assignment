Spring Boot application using Spring Batch to read multi-format car deal csv data into a single format and write to a MySQL database.

"deal_id", "make", "model", "price_Â£", "term", "mileage" and "description" parameters -

                e.g. http://localhost:8080/api/deals/?make=AUDI&model=A5&term=24 will return all 24 month Audi A5 lease deals
